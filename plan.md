# Task Management App Plan

## Notes

- Cross-platform app (iOS + Android) built with React Native.
- Focus: simple yet robust task management with offline-first support.
- Authentication and user data synced with Firebase.
- Tasks stored locally (Realm/SQLite) and synced to Firestore when online.
- App must support push notifications for reminders.
- Modular architecture for scalability and maintainability.
- Environment support: dev, staging, production.
- Theming: light/dark mode toggle.
- State managed using Redux Toolkit.
- Navigation structure: Auth Stack (Sign Up/Login) + App Stack (Task screens).

## Feature List

- Authentication
  - Sign Up & Login using Firebase Authentication (email/password).
  - Persist user session across app restarts.
- Task Management
  - Add, edit, delete tasks.
  - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
  - Tasks stored locally first, then synced to Firestore when online.
- Offline Support
  - Use Realm or SQLite for local task storage.
  - Ensure changes sync automatically when connectivity is restored.
- Push Notifications
  - Local notifications for task reminders.
  - (Bonus) Server push using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
- Multi-Environment Config
  - Separate config for development, staging, and production.
- Theming
  - Support for dark mode and light mode.
- State Management
  - Redux Toolkit for predictable state handling.
- Navigation
  - React Navigation setup with:
    - Auth Stack → Sign Up, Login
    - App Stack → Task List, Task Details, Settings

## Technical Expectations

- Folder Structure
  - Modular, scalable, production-ready organization.
  - Example: src/auth, src/tasks, src/navigation, src/store, etc.
- Performance Optimizations
  - FlatList optimization for task lists (windowing, keyExtractor, memoization).
  - Lazy loading screens to reduce initial load time.
- Testing & QA
  - Test authentication flows, offline task creation, sync logic, and notifications.

## Task List

- Day 1: Project Setup & Architecture

  - [] Configure folder structure (modular, production-ready)
  - [] Set up multi-environment configuration (dev/staging/prod)
  - [] Create sample .env files for each environment
  - [] Install and configure core dependencies:
    - [] Redux Toolkit for state management
    - [] React Navigation for routing
    - [] Firebase SDK (Auth, Firestore, FCM)
    - [] Local database (Realm or SQLite)
    - [] AsyncStorage for session persistence

- Day 2: Authentication & Navigation

  - [] Implement Firebase Authentication setup
  - [] Create authentication screens (Login, Sign Up)
  - [] Build Auth Stack and App Stack navigation structure
  - [] Implement user session persistence
  - [] Add authentication state management with Redux
  - [] Test authentication flow across environments

- Day 3: Task Management Core Features

  - [] Design and implement Task model/schema
  - [] Create task management screens (List, Add, Edit , Delete)
  - [] Implement CRUD operations for tasks
  - [] Set up local database (Realm/SQLite) integration
  - [] Build task state management with Redux Toolkit
  - [] Implement mark complete/incomplete functionality
  - [] Add FlatList optimizations for task listing

- Day 4: Offline Support & Sync

  - [] Implement offline data storage architecture
  - [] Build sync mechanism for online/offline state detection
  - [] Create conflict resolution strategy for sync
  - [] Implement Firestore integration for cloud storage
  - [] Test offline functionality and sync behavior
  - [] Add loading states and sync indicators

- Day 5: Notifications, Theming & Polish

  - [] Implement local push notifications for task reminders
  - [] Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (bonus feature)
  - [] Create dark/light theme system
  - [] Add theme toggle functionality
  - [] Implement lazy loading for screens
  - [] Performance testing and optimizations
  - [] Final testing across all environments

- Documentation & Delivery

  - [] Write comprehensive README with:
    - [] Architecture explanation
    - [] Libraries and rationale
    - [] Environment setup instructions
    - [] Known limitations
    - [] Prepare GitHub repository
    - [] Create demo video or screenshots
  - [] Final code cleanup and comments

## Current Goal

Project MVP complete. Ready for feedback or new features.
